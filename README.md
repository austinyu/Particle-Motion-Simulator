# Particle-Motion-Simulator
This project runs simulations on the motion of charged particles under the influence of different fields. Users can check the demo to see the usage of the particle motion object. 

To Run a simulation, please provide necessary parameters such as particle mass and charge, electric and magnetic fields. 

There is also a playground file for experimentation.
